# Governance

Governance is the process by which Terra network participants can effect change for the protocol, by collectively demonstrating consensus support for proposals.

The Terra ecosystem is controlled by Luna token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that generate a majority support are implemented.

## Proposals

Proposals start out as ideas within the community. A member drafts a proposal into a specific format and submits the proposal alongside an initial deposit.

Proposals that can be automatically applied include:

- `ParameterChangeProposal`: a change to blockchain parameters defined in each module
- `TaxRateUpdateProposal`: an update to the Tax Rate monetary policy lever
- `RewardWeightUpdateProposal`: an update to the Reward Weight monetary policy lever
- `CommunityPoolSpendProposal`: a proposal to disburse funds from the Distribution module's Community Pool

Other issues like large directional changes or decisions requiring manual implementation can also be voted on by submitting a plain `TextProposal`.

Proposals are submitted by creating a proposal, depositing some Luna tokens, and reaching consensus through a community vote.
