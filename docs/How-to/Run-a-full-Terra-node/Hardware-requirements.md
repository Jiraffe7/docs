# Hardware requirements

Running a full Terra node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to just use the Terra blockchain without downloading the entire blockchain, see [Terra Station](https://station.terra.money/).

We recommend the following hardware to run a full node:

- Two or more CPU cores
- At least 1TB of disk storage
- At least 16GB of memory
- At least 100mbps of network bandwidth
